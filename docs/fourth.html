        <p>As I spoke about carnatic music in my previous page, I would like to give some details about this form of music.</p>
        <p>This form of music is more prevalent in South India. There are many great singers in this form. I admire MS.Subbalakshmi garu,
            Nithyasri Mahadevan, Sudha Raghunathan and many other legendary singers. I also like Kunnakudi vaidyanadhan's violin, Rajesh Vaidhya'
            veena etc.
        </p>
        <p>Carnatic music has many ragas and thalas There are about 72 ragas well-known ragas and many others.They are mainly classified into
            Janaka ragas(Parent) and Janya ragas(Derived).
        </p>
